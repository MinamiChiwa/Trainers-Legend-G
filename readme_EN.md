# Introduction

- This plugin can give Umamusume Pretty Derby (DMM Client) players from Mainland China a better experience. There's also a folk of [Traditional Chinese version](https://github.com/yotv2000tw/Trainers-Legend-G-TRANS-zh-tw) .
- The plugin is forked from [`umamusume-localify`](https://github.com/GEEKiDoS/umamusume-localify) by @GEEKiDoS.


# Notice

- The plugin will modify the game file and **chances are that you may be warned or banned by Cygames because of using the plugin** , though we haven't met any players who use it get restricted.
- This repo **ONLY** provides Chinese translation. We currently have no plans for translating the game into other languages.
- However, the plugin itself is **universal**. If you have any motivation to translate the game into other languages, we fully encourage you to set up your own translation repo. If you have any technical problem such as translation files format or how to use the plugin, you can join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/TBCSv5hU69) and contact to our developers.  

- **The plugin source code follows WTFPL license. Any pull request to the plugin source code is welcomed.**
